# YOUTUBE CHANNEL ANALYTICS

This project focuses on analyzing video data from my favorite soccer team in the world FC Barcelona YouTube channel using the YouTube Data API. It includes collecting key channel metrics, performing data preprocessing, and visualizing insights through data analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to uncover trends in video performance, explore patterns in content strategy, and generate visualizations that highlight the most and least successful videos on the channel.
